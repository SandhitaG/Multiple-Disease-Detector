![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b64b72f-45f9-4457-9ad6-59d1ae8efa60)




This project presents a smart **Health Assistant** that uses **Machine Learning** to predict the likelihood of several common diseases including **Diabetes**, **Heart Disease**, **Parkinson's**, **Malaria**, **Chicken Pox**, and **Tuberculosis**. It leverages a simple web-based UI using **Streamlit** for easy access and use by both medical professionals and individuals.
